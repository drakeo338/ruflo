# RuFlo AI Team

RuFlo AI Team is a separate, multi-tenant MCP service and Claude plugin. It turns a reviewed goal into explicit team, run, task, memory, and evidence records without exposing raw operator tools or credentials.

The public v0.1 surface coordinates work; it does not silently send messages, deploy software, execute shell commands, make purchases, or approve consequential actions. Claude Code and Cowork agents use the service as a shared control plane while the user remains the authority for external effects.

## Architecture

- OAuth 2.1 resource server with RFC 9728 discovery and issuer/audience/scope verification.
- Tenant identity derived only from verified token claims; no tool accepts a tenant ID.
- Firestore is canonical storage; an in-memory store is used for tests and local development.
- The default vector backend is the bounded, tenant-scoped `lexical-degraded` fallback. Set `RUFLO_AI_TEAM_VECTOR=native` only after the exact `@ruvector/core` binary passes the startup self-test; an unavailable or incompatible binding falls back explicitly and never claims semantic search.
- Stored task, memory, and evidence content is provenance-labelled and nonce-fenced as untrusted data.
- Twelve focused tools, two prompts, and one public template resource.

## Local verification

```bash
npm install
npm test
npm run smoke
```

Run locally with `RUFLO_AI_TEAM_STORE=memory npm start`. Production requires the exact OAuth resource audience `https://team.ruv.io/mcp`, Firestore IAM, and the environment variables documented in `deploy/cloud-run.yaml`. ChatGPT connections registered before the `team:*` scope ceiling was added must be created again so dynamic client registration includes those scopes.

## Compatibility

The plugin targets Ruflo / `@claude-flow/cli` v3.48 and pins its remote MCP contract at service version 0.1.x. Claude discovers skills, commands, and agents from the canonical plugin directories; the manifest intentionally contains no component arrays.

## Namespace coordination

The plugin owns the `ruflo-ai-team-*` namespace. Tenant data is never separated by a user-supplied namespace: authorization derives the tenant and every repository operation requires it. This follows the `ruflo-agentdb` ADR-0001 namespace convention while treating namespaces as organization aids, not security boundaries.

## Verification

`bash plugins/ruflo-ai-team/scripts/smoke.sh` runs structural checks and the Node test suite. The tests assert the exact tool inventory, complete annotations, OAuth challenges, scope errors, cross-tenant denial, bounded vector indexes, fenced retrieval, and evidence export.
